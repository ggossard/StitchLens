# Customer Support Response Templates

## Payment issue (one-time purchase)
Thanks for reporting this. We can see your purchase attempt and are reviewing it now. If payment succeeded but your pattern is still locked, reply with your project name and purchase timestamp so we can unlock it quickly.

## Subscription billing issue
Thanks for the heads-up. We are reviewing your subscription billing status now. We will confirm your account access and send an update as soon as the billing state is corrected.

## Generation/download delay
Thanks for your patience. We are currently experiencing elevated processing time for pattern generation/downloads. Your project is safe; we will notify you when normal speed is restored.
